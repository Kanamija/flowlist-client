# TODO

Single source of truth for what's left on FlowList. Covers both repos. Keep this file identical in `flowlist-api` and `flowlist-client` — when you check something off in one, mirror it in the other.

## Status

**Today is actually May 6th, we ran out of usage and couldn't update this file. When we begin again on May 7th we will have to review all the files and update the TODO file. The last thing we did was add the code to create a login form in App.tsx, but I just copied and pasted the whole thing and do not understand it very well. Tomorrow (the 7th) I want to review every line of code until I understand it well. We were also supposed to wire the logout button and test the loop in the browser end to end but did not get to that. That will be the first thing we do tomorrow.
**Today:** Tuesday, May 5, 2026
**MVP target:** ~Saturday, May 9, 2026
**Travel:\*\* mid-week, 2–3 working days lost. Plan accordingly — front-load v1 this weekend, push v2 immediately after, save the demo polish for the end of the week.

**The staging rule still wins.** If a v2 task feels tempting before v1 is demo-done in the browser, stop. The whole point of staging is that "almost done" doesn't count.

### End-of-day — Tuesday, May 5

**Done today:**

- Walked through `POST /api/auth/register` line-by-line — every piece now makes sense (parameterized queries, `RETURNING`, `result.rows[0]`, `httpOnly`, why we hash, why 201, what `next(error)` does, etc.). Confident enough to teach it back.
- **Refactored `/register`** into three small same-file helpers — `validateRegistration`, `createUser`, `createSession`. The route handler is now ~10 lines of orchestration that reads top-to-bottom.
  - Replaced the awkward `NOW() + ($2 || ' days')::interval` SQL with a JS-computed `expiresAt` `Date` passed as a normal parameter — much cleaner.
  - Fixed two bugs the refactor surfaced: a typo (`!\n==` instead of `!==`) in the password type check, and a missing `return` in `createSession`. Both caught by the existing test suite.
  - Committed as `refactor(auth): extract register helpers and fix validation typo` and pushed.
- Postman smoke test of `/register` — confirmed 201, `user` body, `Set-Cookie` header. Skipped saving to a Postman collection — Vitest already covers it; not worth fighting Postman's UI for.
- **Built `POST /api/auth/login`** end-to-end:
  - Reused `validateRegistration` for input validation (payoff from yesterday's refactor — same shape as register).
  - New helper `findUserByEmail` for the lookup; returns the row including `password_hash`.
  - `bcrypt.compare` to check submitted password against the stored hash.
  - **No-leak error:** identical `401 'invalid credentials'` for both "no such user" and "wrong password" — prevents user enumeration.
  - `password_hash` stripped from the response body via `const { password_hash, ...userSafe } = user`.
  - Reused `createSession` and the `sid` cookie pattern from register.
- Added 3 login tests (wrong password → 401, non-existent email → 401, happy path → 200 + `Set-Cookie`). All 7 tests in `auth.test.ts` green.
- Walked through every line of those 3 tests — `it`, `request(app)`, `.send`, `toBe` vs `toEqual` vs `toMatchObject`, why `afterEach` matters, the arrange/act/assert pattern.

**Uncommitted at end of day:** the login route + login tests in `src/routes/auth.ts` and `src/tests/auth.test.ts`. First thing tomorrow: commit + push (see Step 1 below).

**Tomorrow (Wednesday, May 6) — clear plan**

**Goal of the day:** finish the v2 backend auth loop. Add `POST /api/auth/logout` so all four routes (register, login, me, logout) are green in Vitest, then add an end-to-end test that walks register → `/me` → logout → `/me`-returns-401 to prove the whole loop fits together.

**Definition of done for tomorrow:** all four auth routes implemented and tested, end-to-end test passing, all changes committed and pushed on `flowlist-v2`. If travel eats into the day, ship in priority order — logout-route → logout-tests → end-to-end → Postman — and drop from the bottom.

---

**Step 1 — Commit Tuesday's login work (~5 min)**

If not done at end of day Tuesday:

- `feat(auth): POST /api/auth/login with bcrypt.compare + session cookie`
- `test(auth): login wrong password, no such user, happy path`

Push.

---

**Step 2 — Build `POST /api/auth/logout` (~20–30 min, learning-first)**

Before writing code, talk through:

- Where does the session id come from? _(`req.cookies.sid` — the cookie that was set during register/login.)_
- What does logout actually do on the server? _(Delete the session row so the cookie can no longer be redeemed.)_
- What if there's no cookie on the request? _(No-op success — logging out when not logged in isn't an error. Return 200.)_
- Why also `res.clearCookie`? _(So the browser stops sending a stale cookie on future requests.)_

Then write it (right after `router.post('/login', ...)` in `src/routes/auth.ts`, with `try/catch` like the others):

1. Read `req.cookies?.sid`. If missing, return 200 with `{ ok: true }`.
2. `DELETE FROM sessions WHERE id = $1` — fine if no row matches.
3. `res.clearCookie('sid', { path: '/' })`.
4. Return 200 with `{ ok: true }`.

---

**Step 3 — Logout tests (~10 min)**

Two tests in `src/tests/auth.test.ts`:

- Logout with no cookie → 200 (no-op).
- Register → logout → `GET /api/auth/me` returns 401 (proves the session was actually deleted server-side, not just the cookie cleared).

For the second test, use supertest's **agent** to carry cookies between calls:

```
const agent = request.agent(app);
await agent.post('/api/auth/register').send({ email: testEmail, password: 'password123' });
await agent.post('/api/auth/logout');
const me = await agent.get('/api/auth/me');
expect(me.status).toBe(401);
```

Plain `request(app)` does _not_ carry cookies between calls; `request.agent(app)` does. That's the key difference.

---

**Step 4 — End-to-end test (~10 min)**

One test that walks the full loop in a single agent:

- Register → 201
- `GET /me` → 200, returns the user
- Logout → 200
- `GET /me` again → 401

When this passes, the v2 backend is done.

---

**Step 5 — Postman smoke test of /login + /logout (~5 min, optional)**

Skip if travel is eating the day. Vitest covers everything; this is muscle memory only.

---

**Step 6 — Final commits + push (~5 min)**

```
feat(auth): POST /api/auth/logout
test(auth): logout no-cookie + logout-clears-session
test(auth): end-to-end register → me → logout → me-401
```

Then **STOP**. Frontend auth UI is still ahead, but the v2 backend is done. Pick up the frontend after travel with fresh focus.

---

**If energy is left over (optional, in priority order):**

- Wire `full_name` into register: accept it from `req.body`, include it in the INSERT, return it in the user object. Small known loose end — column already exists nullable.
- Start the register form in `flowlist-client/src/App.tsx` — just inputs + a submit button calling `fetch('/api/auth/register', { method: 'POST', credentials: 'include', ... })`. No styling.
- Tighten the login happy-path test by asserting `password_hash` is _not_ in the response body (closes a small coverage gap).

**If something blocks you:**

- Read the failure message carefully. Postgres errors usually name the exact column or constraint (the May 4 `full_name` debug is the template).
- Don't change unrelated code while debugging.
- Logout is the simplest of the three routes — if it breaks, it's almost certainly cookie reading or DELETE syntax, not anything subtle.

## Already Done

### Backend (`flowlist-api`)

- [x] TypeScript + Express scaffold (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.env`)
- [x] Supabase project created
- [x] All 5 tables created (`users`, `sessions`, `class_templates`, `class_events`, `bookings`)
- [x] Schema migrated: `class_events.starts_at` replaces the original `date + start_time` pair
- [x] `users.full_name` column exists and is **nullable** — name is not collected at signup yet; wiring it into the register flow + UI is tracked under v2 polish
- [x] DB connection wired up (`src/config/db.ts`)
- [x] `GET /api/health` endpoint returns DB-reachable
- [x] Session middleware code drafted (`src/middleware/sessions.ts`) — paused until v2

### Frontend (`flowlist-client`)

- [x] Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold
- [x] ESLint config

### Documentation (both repos)

- [x] `AGENTS.md` — agent role, project philosophy, staging rules
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Conventional Commits, PR template, comment guidelines
- [x] `README.md` — stranger-facing project overview
- [x] `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` — pitch, problem, success criteria, stretch, out of scope
- [x] `TODO.md` — this file

---

## v1 — Public Class Schedule

**Definition of done:** open the React app in a browser, see real upcoming classes from Supabase with start times in the local time zone. No login, no booking.

### Backend (`flowlist-api`)

- [x] Insert 3+ rows in `class_templates` via the Supabase dashboard (e.g. Vinyasa Flow, Yin, Power)
- [x] Insert 5+ upcoming rows in `class_events` via the Supabase dashboard, spread across the next two weeks
- [x] Add `GET /api/classes` to `src/index.ts` in the same style as `/api/health` — join `class_events` with `class_templates` so the response includes `name` and `description`
- [x] Verify the route in Postman — confirm `name`, `description`, `starts_at`, `duration_minutes`, `instructor`, `max_capacity` are all present
- [x] Bonus: also added `GET /api/classes/:id` for single-class lookup (optional v1 item)
- [ ] ~~Add basic CORS~~ — skipped, using Vite proxy instead

### Frontend (`flowlist-client`)

- [x] Add a `server.proxy` block to `vite.config.ts` so `/api/*` requests forward to `http://localhost:3000`
- [x] Replace the default Vite content in `src/App.tsx`
- [x] Define a `ClassEvent` TypeScript type that matches the API response shape
- [x] Fetch `GET /api/classes` from the schedule page on mount
- [x] Render each class with name, instructor, start time in the local zone, duration
- [x] Add a loading state while the fetch is in flight
- [x] Add an error state for network or 5xx responses
- [x] Add an empty state for "no upcoming classes"
- [x] Sort classes by `starts_at` ascending
- [x] Add a simple v1 presentation pass with FlowList branding and class-card styling

### Demo v1

- [x] Run `npm run dev` in both repos at the same time
- [x] Open the React app in a browser
- [x] Confirm real classes appear, with correct local-zone times
- [x] **STOP. v1 passed; v2 may begin next.**

## v2 — Authentication

**Definition of done:** register through the React UI, refresh the page and stay logged in, log out and watch the indicator update.

**Working agreement:** v2 is a learning-first pass. Go ultra slow, one small concept at a time. Before each code change, explain the problem, the file being touched, the exact code being added, why each non-obvious line exists, and how to test it before moving on. If only v2 gets done but it can be explained clearly, that is a win.

### v2 learning path

- [x] Wire `cookie-parser` into `src/index.ts` and explain middleware order
- [x] Create `src/routes/auth.ts` with a tiny route first, before adding password/session logic
- [x] Mount the auth router at `/api/auth` and explain route prefixes
- [x] Build `POST /api/auth/register` slowly: validate input, hash password, insert user, create session, set `sid` cookie
- [x] Add `GET /api/auth/me` with `requireSession` and explain cookies → sessions → `res.locals.user`
- [x] Add `POST /api/auth/login` and explain password comparison (`bcrypt.compare`, no-leak error message, `password_hash` strip via destructure)
- [x] Add `POST /api/auth/logout` and explain deleting server-side sessions plus clearing the browser cookie
- [ ] ~~Verify each backend route in Postman before touching the frontend~~ — skipped, Vitest already covers register/login/logout end-to-end; not worth the muscle-memory tax this week
- [ ] Add frontend auth UI only after the backend auth loop is understandable

### Backend setup

- [x] Wire up `src/middleware/sessions.ts` in `src/index.ts` — used by the auth router via `requireSession`, no longer dormant
- [x] Pick up the paused `day2-reference.md` walkthrough for `cookie-parser` + `POST /api/auth/register`

### Backend routes

- [x] `POST /api/auth/register` — hash password (bcrypt), insert user, create session row, set `sid` cookie _(refactored into `validateRegistration` + `createUser` + `createSession` helpers)_
- [x] `POST /api/auth/login` — verify password (`bcrypt.compare`), create session row, set `sid` cookie. No-leak `401 'invalid credentials'` for both wrong-password and no-such-user. `password_hash` stripped from response body.
- [x] `POST /api/auth/logout` — delete session row, clear cookie. Reads `req.cookies?.sid`, no-op 200 if missing, otherwise `DELETE FROM sessions WHERE id = $1` and `res.clearCookie('sid', { path: '/' })`.
- [x] `GET /api/auth/me` — return current user from session, or 401 if no session
- [x] ~~Update CORS to allow credentials~~ — skipped, using the Vite proxy so auth requests stay same-origin in dev

### Frontend

- [ ] Register form (email + password)
- [ ] Login form (email + password)
- [ ] Use `fetch(url, { credentials: "include" })` on all auth-relevant calls
- [ ] On app mount, call `GET /api/auth/me` to determine logged-in state
- [ ] "Logged in as X" header indicator (with email or name)
- [ ] Logout button that calls `POST /api/auth/logout` and clears local auth state

### v2 polish (after core auth works)

- [ ] Wire `full_name` into the register flow and the UI so the studio can greet students by name. The column already exists on `users` (nullable) — this is a code change only, not a schema change. Steps: accept `full_name` from `req.body` in `POST /api/auth/register`, include it in the INSERT, surface it in the "Logged in as X" indicator.

### Tests (Vitest + Supertest, in the API repo)

- [x] Auth middleware blocks unauthenticated requests (`/me` without cookie → 401)
- [x] Register: missing fields → 400
- [x] Register: invalid email → 400
- [x] Register: valid input → 201 + `Set-Cookie`
- [x] Login: wrong password → 401
- [x] Login: non-existent email → 401 (same response as wrong password — no enumeration leak)
- [x] Login: valid input → 200 + `Set-Cookie`
- [x] Logout: no cookie → 200 (no-op)
- [x] Logout: clears cookie and deletes session row server-side (verified via follow-up `/me` returning 401, using `request.agent(app)` to carry cookies across calls)
- [x] End-to-end: register → `/me` returns user → logout → `/me` returns 401

### Demo v2

- [ ] Register a new account through the UI
- [ ] Refresh the page — still logged in
- [ ] Log out — indicator updates
- [ ] **STOP. Do not start v3 until this checks pass.**

---

## v3 — Bookings

**Definition of done:** log in, click "Book", see the booking in "My bookings", cancel it. Double-booking and over-capacity attempts return friendly errors backed by database constraints, with tests proving it.

### Schema changes (BEFORE any booking code)

- [ ] Decide `spots_remaining` strategy: (a) drop the column and compute on read as `max_capacity − COUNT(bookings)`, or (b) keep it but only update via `UPDATE … WHERE spots_remaining > 0` and check rowcount
- [ ] Apply the chosen schema change in Supabase
- [ ] Add `UNIQUE (user_id, event_id)` constraint on `bookings`

### Tests (TDD — write the first one BEFORE the route)

- [ ] **Test first:** booking the same class twice returns 409, not 500
- [ ] Capacity enforcement — fill a class, attempt one more signup, expect rejection
- [ ] A student can only cancel their own booking, not someone else's

### Backend routes

- [ ] `POST /api/bookings` — sign up the logged-in user for a class
- [ ] `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` — cancel own booking, with permission check
- [ ] `GET /api/bookings/me` — list the current user's upcoming bookings (needed for the My bookings view)

### Frontend

- [ ] "Book" button on each class in the schedule (only visible when logged in)
- [ ] Disable or hide "Book" when the class is full
- [ ] "My bookings" section that lists the current user's upcoming bookings
- [ ] Cancel button on each booking
- [ ] After book/cancel, refresh the schedule and "My bookings" so the UI matches reality

### Demo v3 — MVP complete

- [ ] Log in through the UI
- [ ] Click "Book" on a class — booking appears in "My bookings"
- [ ] Try to book the same class twice — friendly error, not a 500
- [ ] Cancel a booking — disappears from "My bookings"
- [ ] **MVP complete. Record the demo.**

---

## Attainable Stretch (only if MVP is done early)

Small additions that fit in a few hours each. Anything bigger lives in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` under Stretch Features.

- [ ] Group classes by day in the schedule ("Saturday May 9" with classes underneath)
- [ ] Format duration nicely ("60 min" instead of `60`)
- [ ] Show "X spots left" on each class card (uses whatever `spots_remaining` strategy you chose)
- [ ] Show "✓ Booked" inline on the schedule for classes the current user already booked
- [ ] CSS pass — typography, spacing, color palette that fits a yoga studio
- [ ] Simple footer with studio name and "Powered by FlowList"
- [ ] Friendly 404 / not-found state in the React app
- [ ] Filter classes by instructor (only if the seeded data has enough variety to make it interesting)
- [ ] "Today" / "This week" / "Later" sections in the schedule
- [ ] Disable past classes in the UI (don't render at all, or grey out)

---

## After MVP (do NOT touch this week)

These are listed in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` Stretch Features. Resist the urge:

- Recurring class generation
- Custom admin dashboard (replacing direct Supabase usage)
- Email confirmation and reminders
- Password reset and email verification
- Waitlists
- Public deployment (hosted FE + BE)
- Payments
- Instructor portal
- Mobile-first redesign
- Multi-studio support
